/*	PROGRAM Stock Transaction Simulator

    AUTHOR: Yuri Khechoyan  & Jessie Wilkins
    COURSE NUMBER: CIS 210
    COURSE SECTION NUMBER: 01
    INSTRUCTOR NAME: Dr. Tian
    PROJECT NUMBER: 2 
    DUE DATE: 09/01/2016

SUMMARY

	This program is used to simulate a Stock Transaction. 
	Program will simulate stock purchasing and selling.
	Then it will output a summary telling the user what
	transactions occurred.


INPUT

The input for this program will be Doubles (stock prices), 
Ints (Stock quantity), & Strings (name of user).
Doubles will refer to the US Dollar (USD)

OUTPUT

The input values are echoprinted at the end. 
A multiplication operation will occur to
Calculate how much Commission cost has been deducted
and remove that from total price
Then, the final total will be printed out

ASSUMPTIONS
- Stock quantity purchased will be an integer (greater than 0)
- Purchase prices are in the US Dollar unit (double, greater than 0)
- If whole number is entered, it will be converted into a double
